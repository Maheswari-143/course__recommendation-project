# 🎓 Course Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Course Recommendation System** is an intelligent web-based application designed to help students choose the most suitable courses based on their interests, skills, and career goals.
It solves common problems such as:

* Difficulty identifying the right courses
* Time-consuming search across multiple platforms
* Lack of personalized learning guidance

This system analyzes user input and provides **smart, personalized course recommendations** to support better academic and career decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python
* **Framework:** Flask
* **Database:** CSV / Dataset-based storage
* **Machine Learning:** Recommendation Logic (Similarity / Rule-based / ML model)
* **Libraries Used:**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 How It Works

1️⃣ User enters details such as:

* Area of interest (e.g., AI, Web Development, Data Science)
* Current skills
* Preferred difficulty level
* Career goal

2️⃣ The system processes the input using the recommendation algorithm.

3️⃣ It compares user preferences with the available course dataset.

4️⃣ The system suggests the **most relevant courses** with details.
